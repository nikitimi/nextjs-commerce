The successor to Yamaha’s incredibly successful Arius YDP-144, the YDP-145 delivers a stunning main piano sound derived from a real, top-of-the-line Yamaha CFX acoustic grand piano, mated to a brilliantly playable Graded Hammer Standard keyboard. ❌ Avoid for very young players: Yamaha pianos can have a heavier key action when compared to the likes of Casio and Roland, so it may not be the best option for very young kids. The groundbreaking 700 series features the latest technology developed by Yamaha to perfectly recreate the feel and sound of an acoustic piano. In our tests we found the GrandTouch key action with its Linear Graded Hammer emulation offers a truly authentic touch that will easily convert anyone sceptical of digital pianos. Looking for other options? Take a look at our guide to the best Yamaha digital pianos Read the full Yamaha Clavinova CLP-775 review ❌Avoid if you are seeking a realistic key action: For us, the KDP120 has a fairly basic key action when compared to the likes of Yamaha or Roland. ✅ Buy if are looking for a reliable piano on a budget: For us, Yamaha makes some of the most reliable instruments in the world, and the YDP range proves you don't need to spend a fortune to get a dependable piano. Yamaha’s Arius range of digital pianos sits below the Clavinova range in terms of features and affordability, and as such is the number one choice for piano teachers, students or anybody else who wants a great-sounding, compact digital piano that isn’t going to break the bank or overwhelm the space in the room. The successor to Yamaha’s incredibly successful Arius YDP-144, the YDP-145 is the cheaper of the two full-sized models in the range. The main reasons for the Arius’ popularity is a stunning main piano sound derived from a real, top-of-the-line Yamaha CFX acoustic grand piano, mated to a brilliantly playable Graded Hammer Standard keyboard. These were the two standout features in our tests. There’s no Bluetooth on-board, and only 10 sounds to get to grips with, but you do get all the other essentials - an elegant sliding wooden keyboard cover, folding music desk, two headphone jacks and three pedals - in a choice of White, Rosewood & Black cabinets. Overall, the YDP-145 delivers the authentic piano experience you'd expect from Yamaha in spades. Read the full Yamaha Arius YDP-145 review It’s almost a given that it is going to sound great, it’s made by Roland, but how does it feel? Well, the PHA-4 Standard keyboard offers a great playing experience. The action isn’t as heavy as the Yamaha and isn’t as light as the Casio, so it’s perfect for players seeking the middle ground. The textured keys lend an extra level of authenticity and feel great under the fingers. At the beginner end of the spectrum, there is a decent level of choice, with budget brands such as Donner, Thomann, and Gear4Music producing entry-level instruments for under $/£500. However, you’ll have noticed that we have not recommended any of these products in this guide, as we strongly believe that, if you pay a little more - $/£500+ - you’ll bag a much better instrument. This price range grants you access to very respectable pianos from Yamaha, Casio and Korg, and frankly, the build quality of these instruments is far superior when compared to the likes of the budget brands. For more information on cheaper pianos, be sure to check out our guide to thebest digital pianos under $1,000/£1,000. For intermediates and pros, you’ll be looking at a piano in the thousands, with the average being around $/£2,000. At this price point, you don’t just get an instrument but a piece of furniture that will become the focal point of any room. Pianos in this category will offer the most authentic key action and, therefore, feel indistinguishable from their acoustic counterparts. Again Yamaha, Roland, Korg, Casio and Kawai all offer absolutely stunning pianos for this budget, in various styles.",

This sleek slimline digital piano is perfect for those looking to learn the piano but have limited space. The impressively small stature of the KDP120 still manages to deliver a rich, warm tone, mimicking the sound of the Shigeru Kawai SK-EX concert grand, while its 40W speakers - 20W per side - are more than enough for home practice. Even though this digital piano may come with one of Kawai’s basic key actions - Responsive Hammer Compact II, to be exact - it still feels very responsive and enjoyable to play. This is the same action found on a few of Kawai’s portable options, so if you are familiar with those products, you’ll feel at home on this one.

      "description": "None Our in-house piano experts have chosen the very best digital pianos from Yamaha, Roland, Casio, Kawai and Korg - covering all price points ❌ Avoid for very young players: Yamaha pianos can have a heavier key action when compared to the likes of Casio and Roland, so it may not be the best option for very young kids. ❌ Avoid if you are tight on space: While this piano isn't the largest on this list, it's still fairly big. There are smaller Roland pianos available, so if you are tight on space, it may be worth checking out the F107. It’s almost a given that it is going to sound great, it’s made by Roland, but how does it feel? Well, the PHA-4 Standard keyboard offers a great playing experience. The action isn’t as heavy as the Yamaha and isn’t as light as the Casio, so it’s perfect for players seeking the middle ground. The textured keys lend an extra level of authenticity and feel great under the fingers. ✅ Buy if you want a real hammer action: This stunning Casio piano features real hammers as part of its action, meaning it feels incredibly accurate to a real acoustic piano. Okay, so Casio might not be your first thought for a high-end digital piano, but the Celviano GP-310 may just be the most authentic option on this list. This beautiful piano utilises a real hammer action, which is built in conjunction with one of the most prestigious names in pianos, C. Bechstein - and even uses the same Austrian spruce. While this may not have as many sounds as others on this list, the included sounds are sublime. The three main piano voices - Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg - offer a trio of classic piano sounds perfect for almost any situation. So if you’re in the market for a digital piano with a truly authentic action, then do not overlook the Casio Celviano GP-310 Grand Hybrid.  Read the full Casio Celviano GP-310 Grand Hybrid review That’s where the new Casio PX-S7000 comes in. This sleek and modern instrument is designed to complement your room's decor and even comes in three finish options black, white and the rather striking Harmonious Mustard. Now, it’s not all style over substance, as this piano more than delivers on playability and tone. Casio’s Smart Hybrid Hammer Action Keyboard feels incredibly responsive and offers a very satisfying playing experience, while the Multi-Dimensional Morphing AiR Sound Source delivers a massive range of tones. Read our full Casio PX-S7000HM review At the beginner end of the spectrum, there is a decent level of choice, with budget brands such as Donner, Thomann, and Gear4Music producing entry-level instruments for under $/£500. However, you’ll have noticed that we have not recommended any of these products in this guide, as we strongly believe that, if you pay a little more - $/£500+ - you’ll bag a much better instrument. This price range grants you access to very respectable pianos from Yamaha, Casio and Korg, and frankly, the build quality of these instruments is far superior when compared to the likes of the budget brands.

There are smaller Roland pianos available, so if you are tight on space, it may be worth checking out the F107. If Roland is known for one thing - it’s their outstanding sounds, and the SuperNATURAL sound engine proves Roland knows how to replicate the complex sound of a piano. This incredibly sophisticated tone engine not only delivers fantastic piano sounds, but a whopping 324 voices, as well as limitless polyphony (when using piano category sounds). It’s almost a given that it is going to sound great, it’s made by Roland, but how does it feel? Well, the PHA-4 Standard keyboard offers a great playing experience. The action isn’t as heavy as the Yamaha and isn’t as light as the Casio, so it’s perfect for players seeking the middle ground. The textured keys lend an extra level of authenticity and feel great under the fingers. So if you’re looking for a terrific-sounding digital piano that won’t completely break the bank, then it’s worth considering the Roland HP702.Read our guide for more top choice Roland digital pianos. Read our full Roland HP702 review ✅ Buy if you have limited space: The Roland F107 is ideal for small rooms, flats or student accommodation. ❌Avoid if you aren't interested in apps: For the best results we recommend using the piano with the Roland Piano app. Okay, so pianos are large instruments, but not having the space for a bulky upright digital piano shouldn’t stop you from learning this glorious instrument. The Roland F107 presents you with the exact same key action - PHA-4 Standard - as the larger Roland HP-702 listed above, meaning you don’t have to compromise on the feel when downsizing the cabinet. For us, the Roland F107 is a fantastic, compact, stylish and affordable instrument with a wonderfully playable keyboard and a simplified user interface - that said, we would say you need a great pair of headphones and the Roland Piano app for the best results. Read our full Roland F107 review From afar, the Roland FP-E50 may look like a reasonably standard digital piano, but get closer and you'll realise that it is way more than that. The technologically advanced FP-E50 proves why Roland is at the top of their game, delivering an instrument just as comfortable as the home's main piano as it is a powerful synth or even an arranger keyboard.

Not only is it small, but with the lid closed, it will easily blend into its surroundings - looking more like a sideboard than a piano. Overall the Korg LP-380U feels very robust and is actually made in Kyoto, Japan. This adds a level of quality not seen in other digital pianos of this style, and while we aren’t massive fans of the plastic base on the foot pedals, the rest of the piano feels top-notch.
